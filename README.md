# Penguin UI

A collection of beautifully designed UI components with **Tailwind CSS** and **Alpine JS**.  
[Check the main website](https://www.penguinui.com/).


## Getting Started

To use **Penguin UI**, you simply copy and paste the code from our website; therefore, Penguin UI doesnâ€™t require any installation or npm package. However, it has two main dependencies:

- **Tailwind CSS**: V3.4 or V4.0+
- **Alpine JS**: Some interactive components require the latest version of Alpine JS (currently V3) to function properly.



## Installing Tailwind CSS

There are various ways to install Tailwind CSS. Please refer to [Tailwind's documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to find the best installation method for your project.



## Installing Alpine JS

The easiest way to add Alpine JS to your project is to include it with a `<script>` tag in the `<head>` of your HTML page:

```html
<head>
    ...
    <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
</head>
